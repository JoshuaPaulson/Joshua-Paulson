				<tr>
					<td><p>With all that’s been happening in the United States lately, I’m starting to feel a slight frustration with where our country is heading.  Growing up in the states is supposedly this “amazing opportunity” but is it really?  Yes, we have the freedom to make our own choices and to live our lives to the fullest.  But we’re also the laziest country on the planet, living in a society where celebrities are put on a golden pedestal, and massive race related struggles continue to infuriate people that should be educating themselves instead of bickering.  As Mother Teresa once said, “If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.”  This is a great representation of the new America. We can rally amongst ourselves, but if the causes don’t have a deeper meaning, then what are we really doing?  The more deeply we can learn to love and support one another the more change can be implemented.  Now this isn’t to say that we’ve stopped thinking for ourselves because I have many friends who have worked extremely hard to make a change for themselves and their families.  It is merely a matter of numbers.  The number of people that work hard to learn, grow, and create a positive change for the world around them is so insignificant compared to the amassed group that does not.  Because the great intellectuals are so few and only growing smaller leaves me wondering where are we heading?  Now, I want to briefly discuss that word insignificance, it doesn’t mean unimportant or dying out.  It is more a matter of comparison.  In the words of Mahatma Ghandi, “whatever you do in life will be insignificant, but it’s very important that you do it.”  Now in retrospect, this isn’t saying that all things are as they should be.  Some people might take that quote as a justification for anything they do but what most individuals don’t realize is that a great deal of time is spent doing nothing.  Time wasted on social media, watching Television, or working a dead end job.  Of course we need to stay connected and involved in each other’s lives but it’s often to no avail.  Sometimes it seems that we’re so caught up in the lives of others that we lose ourselves along the way.  As children we have so much wonder and creativity that we often grow out of.  And what I’m urging people to do is push yourselves to learn something new and to get your creative spark back.  It would make a huge difference if we could put aside our insecurities and find a balance in our daily lives.  Between working on our dreams and having fun along the way we could be the most unshakable country.  Somehow, someway, we have to get there, and it all starts with us.</p>

					<td><p>Skateboarding changed my life in a big way over the past few years.  There were many distractions in my life when I was growing up.  My constant search for attention and longing for acceptance led me down a path of proliferation and dissolution.  Every time I joined a new sport or club, it felt like there was finally purpose in my life.  But the feeling always faded.  I often quit when the going got tough and let my teammates down on more than one occasion over the years.  I’ll never forget the day I was late to a Saturday practice with the swim team.  My coach had me wait for the rest of the team to finish and when they got out of the pool our team captain sat down with me.  Tony gave me this look of disappointment as he said, “Josh, you were the one I thought would be my co-captain this year.”  He talked to me in this way, like there was something about me that was destined to be great but I clearly wasn’t living up to my potential, that I was letting everyone down.  We got second place in State that year, but I never joined Tony as co-captain.  I have some regrets about taking part in team sports over the years even though I learned so much along the way.  That following year was my first year of college and I finally walked away from team sports for the last time and to this day have no regrets about quitting college swimming to start skateboarding.  Because when I stepped on a skateboard at the age of 19 years old, it was such a freeing feeling.  Hell, I could push down the road for miles and nobody would give a second thought about it.  That freedom was so addicting, and I couldn’t care less about what people thought.  At first I couldn’t do much more than roll around and I fell down a lot trying to learn tricks.  Yeah it hurts sometimes.  Yes I’ve broken at least 5 bones in the last 5 years.  Sure I’ve felt defeated and wanted to give up on more than one occasion but there’s something that keeps me coming back.  Maybe it’s the freedom, that nobody is telling me what to do but me.  Nobody can make you jump down a set of stairs for hours trying to land your trick.  Maybe it’s that feeling of winning the big game that is in reach every time I step on my board but it’s just you out there, nobody else.  And now, after 6 years of skating I still fall down, still get back up, still get mad when I can’t land my trick, still get frustrated when kids get in my way, still love the feeling of rolling away on a good day.  I’ll keep skateboarding until the day I physically can’t anymore and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

				<tr><td><h4>How I Got Into Design</h4></td></tr>
			</br></br>

				<tr>
					<td><p>When I got into web design it was more about making money and keeping up with one of my closest friends than anything else.  He was already in possession of some excellent domain names and was working extremely hard to Up Rank those sites.  With a little reading material from him and some good advice the possibilities seemed limitless.  We followed a guide that featured 49 pages explaining how to purchase a domain and hosting, how to set up a Wordpress admin for that domain, and which plugins to use for ranking.  Using the guide and a little collaboration I began to see improvement with my SEO on Google and was making money online by the 3rd month.   I continuously saw an increase in revenue for 2+ years and generated over 600,000 page views in 189 countries on two of my top domains.  It was a great learning experience and an amazing introduction to the possibilities of creating websites.  My interests in the last two years have been focused on learning code so that I can upload and design new sites using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and to begin learning PHP.  I will continue to pursue design and plan to learn new languages like PHP and SASS.

				<tr><td><h4>The Influence of Front-End Development</h4></td></tr>
			</br></br>
				<tr>
					<td><p>You know, web design has become a huge part of my life recently.  If you'd asked me in high school what I might be doing for a living later on in life I'd probably have responded with a lame brained theory on how I would be supreme ruler of the world or a wealthy billionaire.  But the truth was that I hadn't a clue as to what I would be doing.  After high school I followed the same path as many others before me by going to college.  In 2010 I attended The University of Wisconsin River Falls.  As an undecided major I was a bit lost and it didn't last all that long.  So I dropped out of school and started to do some soul searching with the help of my closest friends.  By the end of that summer I had started making websites as a means of making money.  It all began when a friend of mine started talking about possibilities online.  He said something about how much money is made via the digital world every single day, hundreds of millions, or billions of dollars every single day online.  And then he made the most radical notion of all, "how easy would it be to get a piece of the action?  All we would need is one percent of that total and we'd be rich.  So we set off making Wordpress sites and doing whatever we could to up rank and drive traffic.  It turned out to be quite profitable and an amazing introduction to creating sites but many of the means I used to generate traffic weren't what you'd call ethical.  Neither was my method of black hat SEO to up rank via YouTube (a good post for another day).  Although my original sites were failures at best, I learned a lot of valuable skills by teaching myself code, practicing SEO, and by making a fair share of mistakes along the way.  But that's what life is all about, making mistakes and learning a great deal along the way.  I think a quote from one of my front-end design teachers say's it best "You know—it's actually shocking how easy it is. Web designers and developers are smart but we're certainly not curing cancer or smashing atoms.  This is something that really anybody can learn how to do.  I think it's very much a skill that can be picked up by practicing just like ark or music or any of the other applied arts.  I view web design and development as not necessarily a science in terms of computer science. I think it's the application of those tools.  So it's actually pretty easy if you're willing to put in the time and effort to learn the skill." Like my passion for skateboarding which is also fairly easy, you have to be willing to put in the time to learn the skill.  It takes hours and hours of trial and error but the reward is always worth it.  Web design has become such a huge part of my life.  And at the rate we consume technology, I think I've made a good choice.</p>
